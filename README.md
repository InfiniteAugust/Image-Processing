# Image-Processing
There are three tasks in this coursework, the basic idea is to represent images in matrices (grayscale, RGB channels), and compute the matrices using MATLAB.
## Task 1 - Face Detector
A face detector using HSV color space or YUV color space.<br>
First, the program learns the features of face color by some pictures of face (skin).<br>
Then, build a model from the previous step and apply it to general pictures.
## Task 2 - Sptial Filters
Implementation of several Spatial Filters including mean, Gaussian, median, anisotropic etc.
## Task 3 - Segment the Retina Blood Vessel
Given a photo of retina, segment the retina blood vessel
